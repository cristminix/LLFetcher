It's a powerful and flexible framework for the modern web designerâ€”whether you use a little of it or a lot. In this course, Joe Chellman offers practical ways to incorporate Vue.js in real-world web designs. He introduces three small projects that benefit from Vue: a real-time updating product customizer that shows how to manage data and respond to events with Vue; an employee directory using Vue forms and animation; and a status board that makes external API calls and uses a third-party Vue component. Each project demonstrates what makes Vue most interesting and useful to web designers and provides solutions for dealing with the few unique challenges.","urn":"urn:li:learningApiCourse:3912329","authors":[{"biography":"Joe Chellman is a web designer, author, and trainer on topics such as WordPress, JavaScript, and jQuery.\\n\\nHe is a web designer in the late 90s sense: a tech generalist who is capable of doing everything a website needs to come to life.

He speaks at conferences, meetups, and workshops throughout his current hometown of Los Angeles, on topics such as WordPress, Drupal, JavaScript, jQuery, and more.
