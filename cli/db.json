Now you're wondering: “How am I going to do that?” BBC-trained video journalist Rob Glass answers this very question and leads you through the labyrinth of choices. Rob has made an average of two video features every week for over 15 years, leading him to a unique multilayered understanding of why certain videos work while others don’t. In this course you can explore the mechanics of video-making—filming, interviewing, editing, narration, graphics, and music—while Rob provides tips to make these elements zing, no matter what camera or editing software you're using. You can also step back from all the intricate workings of filmmaking to take a look at the bigger picture and see how to create video that people truly want to watch.","duration":1751,"id":1,"slug":"creating-fun-and-engaging-video-training-the-how","sourceCodeRepository":null,"title":"Creating Fun and Engaging Video Training: The How","urn":"urn:li:learningApiCourse:4676854"}},"Download":{},"DownloadConfig":{},"DownloadState":{},"ExerciseFile":{},"Section":{"1":{"courseId":1,"id":1,"slug":"yes-you-can-create-great-video-training-no-really-","title":"Yes, You Can Create Great Video Training: No, Really!","tocIds":[1]},"2":{"courseId":1,"id":2,"slug":"1-engaging-video","title":"1.
